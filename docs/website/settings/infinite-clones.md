# Infinite Clones

Infinite Clones disables Scratch's 300 clone limit.

:::caution
Scratch Has a clone limit of 300 by default. by enabling this option, the linit gets remove. just keep in mind that some projects assume that Scratch will prevent it from creating more clones at some point. These projects may break with this option enabled.
