# Custom Stage Size

Scratch has a default screen resolution 480x360 (4:3). this can be changed easliy via Advanced Settings. keep in mind that a screen size too big can lead to the editor being unusable unless reverted.

:::caution
Most projects will not work properly with custom stage size.
:::

640x360 will make a widescreen 16:9 stage. Using higher resolutions such as 1280x720, 1920x1080, or larger is technically possible, but we recommend using a lower resolution with the same aspect ratio and allowing fullscreen mode to upscale it to the user's display (remember that some displays might not even fit such large stages!).

Projects can detect the stage size using methods such as https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/588493413/

::: But on Turbowarp based editors.
